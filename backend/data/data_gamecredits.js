      This was such a fun project to work on! Though our team was relatively small we were able to do a lot. I focused much of my time on destruction, using tools such as Houdini to create sims and building a viable pipeline for the game. We were pushing for 60fps so we had to be really creative in how we implemented things.

      One huge leg up we had was actually using Unreal 4. Had we tried to use a homebrew I have doubts we would have been able to finish the game at quality in the time we had. I believe we knocked this out in around a year or so from scratch. There was such nestalgia working on this game. I remember growing up playing this and being addicted to it.
